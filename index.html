    <em>Former Dental Assistant, Self taught Developer</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    I've always had a passion for techology. My first major in college was computer engineer.
    After struggling through my first programming class (<em>C++</em>) and pre calculus.
    I deviated away from technology for a while to focus on Dentistry. After 2 years of working as
    a dental assistant and having my daughter. I discovered the IT field was <strong>MUCH</strong>
    bigger than I thought. IT was more than just software and hardware engineering. I decided to
    finish my passion of technology once again. This time I <strong>WILL SUCCEED</strong>!
